The value of basic science is to gain knowledge.
The value of ethics is to provide orientation.
The value clinical research is to facilitate patient well-being.

To understand how these values are interconnected, we must acknowledge that it matters ethically what we think to know. This is the ethics of epistemic belief in Translational Research.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
